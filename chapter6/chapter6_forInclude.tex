\section{Mixture Models}\label{sec:mixtureModels}

In the previous chapter we have mentioned that it may happen that a likelihood function has multiple 
maxima and that sometimes it may be hard or impossible to find the global maximum (i.e.\ the maximum
with the overall highest likelihood value). Such a situation occurs whenever the probabilistic model
that we use to model our observations is a \textbf{latent} or \textbf{hidden variable model}. Latent variable
models are models that besides modelling observed data also model a portion of unobserved data. For
example, if we look at the income distribution of a population we may want to further differentiate
between age groups. If the age of all or some members of the population is not provided in the data, we
can still model it as a latent variable. The difficulty is that we will have to make inferences about the
age of an individual based on other information that we have about it (e.g. the income). 

While it may in general be quite hard to formulate latent variable models, there are certain standard
latent variable models that have wide-spread applications. One such class are \textbf{mixture models}.

\begin{Definition}[Mixture Model]\label{def:mixtureModel}
Given any set of probability distributions $ P_{X_1}, \ldots, P_{X_n} $ 
we define a mixture model as
$ P_X = \underset{i=1}{\overset{n}{\sum}} \alpha_{i}P_{X_i} $
where we require that all $ \alpha_{i} \geq 0$ and 
$ \underset{i=1}{\overset{n}{\sum}} \alpha_{i} = 1 $.
We call the distributions $ P_{X_1}, \ldots, P_{X_n} $ \textbf{mixture components} and their weights
$ \alpha_{i} $ \textbf{mixture weights}.
\end{Definition}

Mixture models are extremely useful whenever we have different ways to think about our data. Each way
of conceptualising our data can be encoded by one of the mixture components of the mixture model.
This can help us to build a better overall model of our data. Let us introduce a running example that
we use for the rest of this section. 

\paragraph{Example of a mixture model} Assume we observe 20 sequences of coin tosses. Each sequence
contains 10 flips. We also know that there are 3 coins with which these sequences could possibly have been
generated and for each sequence a different coin may have been used. Coin 1 is unbiased, coin 2 has
parameter $ \theta = 0.4 $ and coin 3 has parameter $ \theta = 0.65 $. 
 
We could assume that the entire data set was generated by exactly one coin. We would then employ maximum likelihood estimation 
to find the parameter of that coin. However, this model might actually turn out to be
pretty bad because we are committing to picking only one coin. This is a bad assumption because we said in the beginning that
each sequence may possibly have been generated by a different coin. 

A mixture model comes to the rescue. Instead of assuming that only one coin has generated all 20 sequences,
we assume that all three coins have contributed to generating the 20 sequences. However, their contributions
may not be equal. This inequality is exactly what the mixture weights capture. As usual, we call our data $ x $. Also, each mixture component is a binomial distribution, parametrized by the parameters of
the coins. This information suffices to formulate our mixture model.
\begin{align} 
\begin{split} \label{eq:mixtureExample}
P(X=x|&\Theta_{1}^{3}=\theta_{1}^{3}, A = \alpha_{1}^{3}) 
= \alpha_{1}P(X=x|\Theta_{1}=0.4) \\
&\quad + \alpha_{2}P(X=x|\Theta_{2}=0.5) + \alpha_{3}P(X=x|\Theta_{3}=0.65)
\end{split}
\end{align}

Notice that if we were given the mixture weights, estimating
the parameters of the mixture components would be easy: we would simply find the MLE for each mixture component. The mixture
model could then easily be constructed because the mixture weights are known. 

Usually, we face a more difficult problem when working with mixture models. Neither the mixture
weights nor the parameters of the mixture components are known. For ease of exposition, we will focus
on the medium hard case where we know the mixture components, but do not know the mixture weights.

How can we go about estimating the weights? First, observe the constraints
on mixture weights in Definition~\ref{def:mixtureModel}. All mixture weights have to be non-negative and they have to sum to 1.
These constraints mean that we can interpret the weights as a probability distribution. In particular, the weights form a distribution over parameters
of the mixture components (assuming that all mixture components have the same parametric form). That is, we get the following
relations:
\begin{equation}
\hskip 0.5cm \alpha_{1} = P(\Theta_{1} = \theta_{1}) \hskip 0.5cm \alpha_{2} = P(\Theta_{2} = \theta_{1}) \hskip 0.5cm \alpha_{3} = P(\Theta_{3} = \theta_{1})
\end{equation}
Hence, we can rewrite our mixture model as
\begin{align} 
\begin{split} \label{eq:probabilisticMixtureModel}
&P(X=x) 
= P(\Theta_{1} = 0.4)P(X=x|\Theta_{1}=0.4) \\
&\quad + P(\Theta_{2} = 0.5)P(X=x|\Theta_{2}=0.5) + P(\Theta_{3} = 0.65)P(X=x|\Theta_{3}=0.65)
\end{split}
\end{align}

In our examples, we assume that we have only three possible binomial parameters, namely $ \theta_{1} = 0.4, \theta_{2} = 0.5, \theta_{3} = 0.65 $. 
Each summand
in \eqref{eq:probabilisticMixtureModel} is in fact a joint distribution by the chain rule so that we can again rewrite the model as
\begin{align}
\begin{split}\label{eq:marginal}
P(X=x) &= P(X=x,\Theta_{1}=0.4) + P(X=x,\Theta_{2}=0.5)  \\
&\quad + P(X=x,\Theta_{3}=0.65)
\end{split} \\
&= \underset{i=1}{\overset{3}{{\sum}}} P(X=x,\Theta=\theta_{i}) \nonumber
\end{align}
where \eqref{eq:marginal} is a simple marginalisation step. Notice that we have just accomplished something impressive: we have given a probabilistic justification
for why mixture models do indeed model our data. Each mixture-component/weight pair gives rise to a joint distribution over parameters and data but by summing over the 
possible parameters we get the probability of the data. We can easily show that mixture models can be defined for any number of mixture components.

\begin{Exercise}
Show that a mixture model of size $ n $ is a model of the data, i.e.\ show that $  \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_{i}P(X_i=x) = P(X=x) $ if $ \alpha_{i} $ are mixture weights as 
defined in Definition~\ref{def:mixtureModel}.
\end{Exercise}

Notice that we have shown above that the formulation of mixture models as purely probabilistic models and as linear combinations of probability distributions are
equivalent. So why did we even bother to give a purely probabilistic justification? On the one hand, it is mathematically satisfying to trace back new concepts
to concepts that we are already familiar with (like joint distributions and the chain rule). More importantly, however, the probabilistic interpretation of mixture
weights allows to estimate them using the maximum-likelihood principle. This estimation is something we could not have done if we had regarded them solely as scale factors
for the mixture components. 

There is one additional problem, however: if the mixture weights are unknown, there is no closed-form solution for estimating the likelihood function. This is because
the likelihood depends on the parameters of the mixture components whose distribution, given
by the mixture weights, is unknown. This means that while we can compute the likelihood for each
individual mixture component, we cannot compute the likelihood of the entire mixture model because we
do not know how much each component contributes to the overall likelihood term. As a consequence, we can not 
simply apply calculus as we have been doing up to now. For this reason, we turn to the \textbf{EM algorithm}, 
that allows to at least find a local maximum of the likelihood function.

One final note: At the beginning we introduced latent variable models (and hence mixture models) as models
of \textit{latent data}. We have cast the problem of inferring the mixture weights as inferring a 
distribution over mixture components, however. One may argue that those are not data, neither latent nor 
observed. This is a fair criticism but there is an easy way out. Simply imagine that each sequence of coin
flips was annotated with a pointer to the mixture component (the coin) that generated it. This annotation
is clearly part of the data. Since in our actual data, these annotations are missing, we treat them as 
latent data. This strategy of defining additional latent random variables that serve as pointers or
stand-ins for mixture components is often employed in the literature. Obviously, seeing mixture weights
as probabilities of mixture components or probabilities of pointers to mixture components is fully 
equivalent.

\section{The EM algorithm}

In order to estimate the parameters of mixture models, we can employ a classical algorithm of 
\textbf{unsupervised learning}, namely the \textbf{expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm}. This
algorithm allows to find a local maximum of the likelihood function of mixture models or, more
generally, models with missing data. 

To give you some more intuition for what latent data is we provide a further example that has
spawned a lot of research. Assume you run a website that recommends movies
based on a user's preferences. In order to make statistical predictions about what type of user
likes what kind of movie, you ask your users to rate movies according to different categories.
Say you ask your users to rate the movies for entertainment value, action and fun. What may happen is
that some of your users only rate a movie in one or two of these three categories. However, these
ratings are still valuable to you and you do not want to throw them away, just because the rating is
incomplete in one category. Thus you have a data set with some missing data that you have to fill in somehow.

\medskip 
In mixture models, annotations that tell you which mixture component
generated a given data point can be thought of as missing data. As we have seen, such annotations
are usually missing and thus we cannot do maximum likelihood estimation. The idea of EM is to
make an educated guess at the probability with which each mixture component could \textit{potentially}
have generated each data point. What we do know is our observed data and some initial guess of the mixture
weights which act as prior probabilities for the mixture components (this guess may be arbitrary). 
Our educated guess is then simply based on Bayes' rule. It is the posterior probability of each mixture
component given the data point.

Using the posterior over mixture components, the EM algorithm allows us to probabilistically fill in the missing data and find good mixture weights
(where you should understand \textit{good} in the maximum-likelihood sense). The idea behind the
algorithm is simple: compute the expected number of occurrences of the missing data values (the mixture 
components) and then do maximum likelihood estimation on those expectations. Repeat the procedure 
until the likelihood does not increase any further. Notice that this procedure requires to
fix the number of mixture components in advance.

More formally, assume a data set $ x_{1}^{n} $. Furthermore, define $ Y $ as a random variable over $ m $ possible
mixture components (we normally choose $ m << n $). Then the likelihood function is 
\begin{align}
L_{x}(\theta) = P(X=x|\Theta=\theta) = \underset{y=1}{\overset{m}{\sum}} P(X=x, Y=y|\Theta=\theta)
\end{align}
where $ \Theta $ ranges over the parameters of the joint distributiforon $ P_{XY} $. Recall that EM
probabilistically fills in missing data. However, since we are doing maximum likelihood estimation, we
are not so much interested in the missing data itself but rather in the sufficient statistics of
that data (see Section \ref{sec:sufficientStats}). Since we cannot directly obtain the sufficient statistics
of missing data, we will instead compute the \textit{expected sufficient statistics} where the expectation
is taken per data point with respect to the posterior distribution over mixture components.

Since we are referring to sufficient statistics our exposition of EM is specific to distributions
in the exponential family. The EM algorithm can also be made more general. However, since virtually
all distributions that are of interest in practice do belong to the exponential family, we will not make this kind of generalisation.

It is important to notice that the distribution over mixture components is always a categorical distribution
for which each mixture component constitutes an outcome. Since the sufficient statistics for the
categorical are simply the counts of the outcomes, we have already identified an important set of
sufficient statistics that we will need in any EM algorithm. Be aware, however, that the sufficient 
statistics for the mixture components (if we wish to estimate their parameters as well) may be different
from the categorical sufficient statistics.

The EM algorithm is an iterative 
algorithm, meaning we repeat its steps several
times. We use superscripts to indicate the number $i$ of the repetition, where $ 0 \leq i \leq k $.
To formalize the EM algorithm, assume we are at iteration $i$ for which we have some parameter estimate 
$\theta^{(i)} $ (the initial estimate $\theta^{(0)}$ can be set arbitrarily). Based on this parameter 
estimate we then compute the expected sufficient statistics
of the missing data which we call $ t(y) $.
\begin{equation} \label{Estep}
t(y)^{(i+1)} = \E(t(Y)|X = x,\Theta = \theta^{(i)})
\end{equation} 

Equation~\eqref{Estep} is known as the \textbf{E(xpectation)-step} of the EM algorithm. This name
comes from the fact that in this step we compute the expected sufficient statistics. 
To make the algorithm complete, we still miss a
\textbf{M(aximization)-step}. But that step is simple. We pretend that the expected sufficient statistics of 
the latent data were actually observed. Once we pretend to observe the expected statistics, the maximization 
step can be performed using be maximum-likelihood estimation:
\begin{equation} \label{Mstep}
\theta^{(i+1)} = \underset{\theta}{\arg\max} P(X=x, t(Y) = t(y)^{(i+1)}|\theta)
\end{equation}

\begin{Definition}[EM algorithm]\label{def:EM}
We assume a data set $ x = x_{1}^{n} $ and postulate that there is unobserved data $ y = y_{1}^{m} $ which
is a realisation of RV $ Y $. We also
assume a probabilistic model whose parameters are realisations of a RV
$ \Theta $. Let $ t(y) $ be the sufficient statistics of a realization $ y $. Then any
iterative algorithm with $ k $ iterations that performs the following
steps for $0\leq i \leq k-1$, 
\begin{align*}
\mbox{\textbf{E-step:} } \quad t(y)^{(i+1)} &= \E(t(Y) \mid X = x, \Theta = \theta^{(i)}) \\
\mbox{\textbf{M-step:} } \qquad \theta^{(i+1)} &= \underset{\theta}{\arg\max} \; P(X=x, t(Y) = t(y)^{(i+1)} \mid \Theta = \theta) 
\end{align*}
to update the model parameters is called an EM algorithm. 
\end{Definition}

\paragraph{Example of an EM algorithm} Assume as in Section~\ref{sec:mixtureModels} that our data is $ x=x^{20}_{1} $ where each $ x_{i} $ is the 
number of heads that we observed in a sequence of a 10 coin tosses. Again we also assume mixture components that are binomials with parameters
$ 0.4, 0.5, 0.65 $. The latent data in this case is an annotation that for each observed sequence $ x_{i} $ reveals the coin that has been used
to generate that sequence. Thus we have latent data $ y=y_{1}^{n} $ with $ y_i \in \supp(Y) = \{0.4,0.5,0.65\} $. Both the observed and latent variables
are assumed i.i.d.
We assume that the fair coin is more likely to be used and hence set its initial mixture weight to $ 0.5 $ and the mixture weights of the 
other two coins to $ 0.25 $ (any other choice would also be fine). Let 
us take a closer look at our data. To shorten notation, we write it as a list where the i$ ^{th} $ entry is the value of $ x_{i} $.
$$ [6, 5, 4, 2, 6, 6, 6, 5, 4, 2, 5, 5, 3, 4, 6, 4, 5, 6, 3, 3 ] $$ 
Then for each $ x_{i} $ we assume that it was generated by each of the three coins. For the first observation we get the following likelihood values.
\begin{align}
&P(X_{1}=6|\Theta=0.4) = 0.1114767& \\
&P(X_{1}=6|\Theta=0.5) = 0.2050781& \nonumber \\ 
&P(X_{1}=6|\Theta=0.65) = 0.2376685& \nonumber
\end{align}

Recall that the mixture weights are nothing else than priors over mixture components. Hence, in order to get the joint distribution over observed and
latent data, we multiply the likelihoods by the mixture weights.
\begin{align}
&P(X_{1}=6,\Theta=0.4) = 0.25 \times P(X_{1}=6|\Theta=0.4) = 0.02786918 \\
&P(X_{1}=6,\Theta=0.5) = 0.5 \times P(X_{1}=6|\Theta=0.4)  = 0.1025391 \nonumber \\ 
&P(X_{1}=6,\Theta=0.65) =  0.25 \times P(X_{1}=6|\Theta=0.4)  = 0.05941712 \nonumber
\end{align}

We are interested in the posterior over mixture components. Because we are dealing with a categorical
distribution here, the posterior probability is exactly the expected
number of times that each coin has generated data point $ x_{1} $. The
posterior given $ x_{1} $ is shown below.
\begin{align}\label{eq:posterior}
P(\Theta=0.4|X_{1}=6) = \frac{P(X_{1}=6,\Theta=0.4)}{P(X_1 = 6)} = 0.146814 \\
P(\Theta=0.5|X_{1}=6) = \frac{P(X_{1}=6,\Theta=0.5)}{P(X_1 = 6)} = 0.5401758 \nonumber \\
P(\Theta=0.65|X_{1}=6) = \frac{P(X_{1}=6,\Theta=0.65)}{P(X_1 = 6)} = 0.3130094 \nonumber
\end{align}

We compute these expectations for each data point and add them up. The added expectations give
us the expected sufficient statistics of the categorical over mixture components for this data set.
This completes the E-step.

In the M-step we assume that these expected values are the actual counts of how often we have observed each latent value. Let us call the counts 
$ c_{0.4}, c_{0.5}, c_{0.65} $ where the index points to the corresponding mixture component. According to our model, the mixture components are categorically
distributed and thus in the M-step we want to find the MLE of that categorical. In general, the MLE for $ \theta_{i} $ of a categorical is
$ \frac{c_{i}}{n} $\footnote{This fact can easily be seen by letting $ c_{i} $ be the number of successes in the realisation of a binomial RV and the sum of all
$ c_{j},~j \not = i $ be the number of failures. Then clearly $ \frac{c_{i}}{n} $ is the MLE.}. In our case $ n=20 $. Thus we set 
$ \theta_{i}^{(1)} = \frac{c_{i}}{20} $ and complete the M-step. With our new parameter estimates, we can proceed to the second iteration of EM.

For our concrete example, we have already computed the posterior distribution when their are 6 successes
in 10 coin flips. Our data also contains the outcomes 2,3,4 and 5. All posteriors are summarized in 
Table~\eqref{tab:posteriors}. The table also contains the number of occurrences of each outcomes in our
data set. What is left is to add up the posteriors per data point. Since all outcomes occur multiple
times, we can simply multiply the posterior probabilities for each outcome with its number of occurrences.
For $ \theta_{1} $ this gives:
\begin{align}
\E(t(y_{1})) = &2 \times 0.5674795 + 3 \times 0.4568744 + 4 \times 0.3436451 + \\
&5 \times 0.237068 + 6 \times 0.1114767 = 5.946387 \nonumber
\end{align}

By parallel calculations we get $ \E(t(y_{2})) = \textsc{10.7153} $ and $ \E(t(y_{3})) = 3.338238 $. 
These are our expected sufficient statistics. Importantly, we get 
$ \E(t(y_{1})) + \E(t(y_{2})) + \E(t(y_{3})) \approx 20 $ (there is some slight numerical imprecision
caused by our computer).
